## No need to supply username and password here, as the parameter "dbms.security.auth_enabled" (which is set to true by default) has been disabled in the /conf/neo4j.conf

## alternatively,
graph <- startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username = "neo4j" ,password = "up32cd4346")

## eliciting all cell types available in the database.
query= "MATCH ()-[r]-() WHERE EXISTS(r.CellType) RETURN DISTINCT r.CellType AS CellType"
