This notebook 
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r Downloading Neo4j access libraries}
#1#
BiocManager::install("neo4r")
library(neo4r)

#2#
devtools::install_github("nicolewhite/RNeo4j")
library(RNeo4j)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r call the Neo4j instance that is currently in execution}

graph <- startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/") 
## No need to supply username and password here, as the parameter "dbms.security.auth_enabled" (which is set to true by default) has been disabled in the /conf/neo4j.conf



```
