    "Transcription Factories are those purported sites that have been identified as the breeding grounds for transcripts. Their relevance heightens when the spatial organization of the genome is considered. Since transcription factories attract distant segments of the genome together for inter-mingling and possibly carrying out regulation, true picture emerges of the parts that co-localize and co-express. This has been a major lacuna in the dogma of the current suite of enrichment tools for genomic regions."
