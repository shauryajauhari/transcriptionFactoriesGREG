Eliciting Transcription Factories from GREG data.

## Theory
Transcription factories have been identified as the *breeding grounds for transcripts*. There relevance heightens when the spatial organization of the genome is considered. Since transcription factories attract distant segments of the genome together for inter-mingling and possibly carrying out regulation, true picture emerges of the parts that **co-localize** and **co-express**. This has been a major lacuna in the dogma of the current suite of enrichment tools for genomic regions.

## Objective
The aim of this study is to provide for a genome-wide mapping of Transcription Factories, based on which we shall further draw listing of the cis-interacting fractions of the genome.
